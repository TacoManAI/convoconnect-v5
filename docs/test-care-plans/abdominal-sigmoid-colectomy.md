1. MEDICATIONS  
   • Acetaminophen 650 mg tablets – Take 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain.  
   • Oxycodone 5 mg tablets – Take 1 tablet by mouth every 6 hours **only if** pain is not controlled by acetaminophen. Do **not** exceed 4 tablets in 24 hours. May cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery.  
   • Ibuprofen 600 mg tablets – Take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours with food for the first 7 days to reduce inflammation, unless you have kidney issues or your primary physician advises otherwise.  
   • Senna-S 8.6 mg/50 mg tablets – Take 2 tablets at bedtime until normal bowel movements resume.  
   • Cephalexin 500 mg capsules – Take 1 capsule by mouth every 8 hours for 5 days (antibiotic prophylaxis).  
   • Simethicone 125 mg chewable tablets – Chew 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed for bloating or gas.  
   • **Resume** your regular medications for hypertension (Lisinopril 10 mg daily) and cholesterol (Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly) starting tomorrow morning unless instructed otherwise.

2. RED-FLAG SYMPTOMS – SEEK HELP IMMEDIATELY  
   • Fever > 101.4 °F (38.5 °C) or chills that do not resolve with acetaminophen.  
   • Sudden increase in abdominal pain, hard rigid abdomen, or pain not relieved by prescribed meds.  
   • Bright-red bleeding from incision sites or blood soaking through the dressing.  
   • Nausea/vomiting that prevents you from keeping food, fluids, or medications down.  
   • Shortness of breath, chest pain, or rapid heart rate (> 120 bpm) at rest.  
   • Calf swelling, redness, or pain (possible blood clot).  
   • No bowel movement and no gas (“flatus”) for more than 72 hours after discharge.  
   • Yellowing of the skin or eyes (possible bile leak).  
   If any of the above occur, **call 911** or go to the nearest Emergency Department.

3. INCISION & WOUND CARE  
   • Small Steri-Strips are in place over each laparoscopic port site. Keep them dry.  
   • You may shower 48 hours after discharge; gently let soap and water run over the sites, pat dry with a clean towel. Do **not** scrub or apply lotions/ointments.  
   • Allow Steri-Strips to fall off naturally (usually 7–10 days).  
   • Inspect the area daily for redness > ½ inch, foul odor, or purulent drainage.

4. ACTIVITY & EXERCISE  
   • Walk at least 5–10 minutes, 3 times per day, starting the evening of discharge; gradually increase distance as tolerated.  
   • No lifting > 10 lbs (about a gallon of milk) for 4 weeks.  
   • Avoid core-strengthening exercises, sit-ups, or heavy housework (vacuuming, mowing) for 6 weeks.  
   • You may climb stairs slowly; hold the railing and pause if dizzy.  
   • **Driving:** wait until you are off narcotic pain medication for 24 hours and can turn your torso comfortably; usually 7–10 days post-op.  
   • Sexual activity can resume when comfortable, typically after your 2-week follow-up and once bleeding has stopped.

5. DIET & HYDRATION  
   • Start with clear liquids (broth, gelatin, water, diluted juice) for 24 hours, then advance to low-residue soft foods (oatmeal, scrambled eggs, yogurt).  
   • Avoid high-fiber foods (raw vegetables, popcorn, nuts) for 2 weeks.  
   • Drink at least 2 liters of water daily unless restricted for kidney/heart reasons.  
   • Limit caffeine to 1 cup/day; avoid alcohol for 14 days while on antibiotics and narcotics.  
   • Small, frequent meals (5–6/day) are easier on digestion than 3 large meals.

6. BOWEL & BLADDER FUNCTION  
   • Mild constipation is common; continue Senna-S nightly until soft bowel movements occur.  
   • If no bowel movement by postoperative day 4, take 1 dose of polyethylene glycol (Miralax) mixed in 8 oz water; contact the office if ineffective.  
   • Passing gas is a good sign; slight abdominal bloating is normal.  
   • Urinate every 4–6 hours; contact clinic if burning, urgency, or output < 200 mL over 8 hours.

7. FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS  
   • Surgical clinic follow-up with Dr. Harmon in **7 days**: Tuesday, 2024-06-19 at 10:15 AM, Suite 415, Skyline Medical Center. Call (555) 244-8820 if you need to reschedule.  
   • Primary Care Physician review of blood pressure meds in **14 days** or sooner if BP > 150/95 mm Hg.  
   • Colonoscopy screening (to inspect new anastomosis) due in **12 months**; referral will be placed.  
   • Visiting Nurse Service will call within 48 hours post-discharge to schedule a home visit for vital-sign check and wound review.

8. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS  
   • Wear compression stockings (TED hose) during the day for 2 weeks to reduce DVT risk.  
   • Keep a pain and activity diary—record medication doses, pain scores (0–10), and distance walked each day. Bring to your follow-up.  
   • Use an incentive spirometer 10 breaths every hour while awake for the first 3 days to prevent pneumonia.  
   • All prescription refills must be coordinated through surgical clinic (phone above).  
   • Travel: avoid flights > 2 hours for 4 weeks; if unavoidable, stand and walk every hour and consider aspirin 81 mg daily (confirm with PCP).
