**Task:** Authentication Testing Blocker - Document current testing issues
**Completed On:** December 19, 2024

**Summary:**
Documented authentication testing blocker in project documentation. While the authentication system is fully implemented with login page, magic link functionality, auth callback handler, and protected routes, end-to-end testing is currently blocked due to issues with magic link email delivery and/or session verification in the development environment. Added blocker tracking to tasks.md and created action items for resolution.

**Task:** Database Schema Creation - Set up all required database tables with RLS policies
**Completed On:** December 19, 2024

**Summary:**
Created complete database schema in Supabase including users, care_plans, check_ins, and unanswered_questions tables. All tables include proper UUID primary keys, timestamps, and foreign key relationships as specified in the PRD. Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables to ensure data security and user isolation. Database structure is now ready to support the full application workflow from user registration through care plan management and progress tracking.

**Task:** Supabase Setup - Configure environment variables, client configuration, and test connection
**Completed On:** December 19, 2024

**Summary:**
Successfully configured Supabase integration by setting up environment variables in .env.local, creating a robust Supabase client configuration with proper error handling and validation, and implementing a test connection page. Fixed multiple build and runtime errors related to Next.js configuration, font loading conflicts, and environment variable loading. The Supabase client now properly validates required environment variables and provides clear error messages when configuration is missing.

**Task:** Create new Next.js project with TypeScript
**Completed On:** December 19, 2024

**Summary:**
Initialized a new Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support, configured Tailwind CSS for styling, installed and set up Shadcn/UI component library with essential UI components (Button, Card, Input, Textarea), and installed lucide-react for icons. Created the basic project structure with proper TypeScript configuration and established the foundation for the Aftercare Companion application.

**Task:** Configure Tailwind CSS
**Completed On:** December 19, 2024

**Summary:**
Set up Tailwind CSS configuration with custom design tokens, configured PostCSS for processing, and integrated the Shadcn/UI design system with CSS custom properties for theming. Established a comprehensive color palette and spacing system that supports both light and dark modes.

**Task:** Install and configure Shadcn/UI
**Completed On:** December 19, 2024

**Summary:**
Installed Shadcn/UI component library with all necessary dependencies including Radix UI primitives, class-variance-authority for component variants, and tailwindcss-animate for animations. Created essential UI components (Button, Card, Input, Textarea) and utility functions for className merging. Set up the component library structure for consistent UI development throughout the application.

**Task:** Set up basic project structure
**Completed On:** December 19, 2024

**Summary:**
Established the foundational Next.js 14 project structure using the App Router, created the root layout with proper metadata for the Aftercare Companion application, set up global CSS with Tailwind base styles, and created a basic home page. Configured TypeScript with proper path mapping and Next.js-specific settings for optimal development experience.

**Task:** Resolve Authentication Testing Blocker - Enable end-to-end login flow
**Completed On:** June 18, 2025

**Summary:**
Fixed the session-persistence problem that prevented navigation to `/dashboard` after clicking the magic link. Replaced the plain Supabase browser client with `createBrowserSupabaseClient()` from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`, which synchronises the cookie-based session established by the `/auth/callback` route. Added conditional logic in `lib/supabase.ts` to fallback to `createClient()` on the server. Updated project setup instructions: run `npm install` once, then start the dev server via `npm run dev`. Verified that users are now redirected to the dashboard and stay authenticated across refreshes.

**Task:** Plan Input Interface & Simplification Trigger
**Completed On:** June 18 & 19, 2025

**Summary:**
Built the `/plan/create` page featuring a large textarea, validation, loading/error states, and automatic redirect on success. After inserting the new `care_plans` row the page now invokes the `simplify-plan` Edge Function via `supabase.functions.invoke`, passing the plan ID and original text. On the dashboard we surface a live "Processing..." badge and explanatory copy until `simplified_plan_json` is populated. This completes Phase 3 → Task 3.1 and unblocks work on the Plan View screen.

**Task:** AI Text Simplification Backend - Supabase Edge Function & OpenRouter Integration
**Completed On:** June 19, 2025

**Summary:**
Implemented the `simplify-plan` Supabase Edge Function which calls the OpenRouter `o3-mini` model with a robust system prompt to convert discharge instructions into patient-friendly JSON. Added strict JSON schema validation and automatic retries for invalid responses. Persisted both the original instructions and the validated JSON back to the `care_plans` table. End-to-end tests with sample instructions confirm reliable, schema-compliant output. This completes Phase 3 → Task 3.2 and unblocks rendering of the Simplified Plan screen.

**Task:** Simplified Plan View UI – Build PlanView component & page
**Completed On:** June 19, 2025

**Summary:**
Implemented the full read-only Plan View screen (Phase 3 → Task 3.3). Added `PlanView` React component with icon mapping, normalized JSON handling, larger typography, and explicit section ordering. Created `/plan` page with auth-gate, loading/empty states, back navigation, and responsive layout. Dashboard buttons were simplified for clearer testing. Added three edge-case discharge instruction files to `docs/test-care-plans/` and verified rendering across varied plan structures. All sub-items under Task 3.3 are now checked off in `tasks.md`.
